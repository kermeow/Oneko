# Rojo Plugin Template

It's recommended to use [this Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cantonios.project-templates) for handling placeholders.

## Requirements

-   Rojo
-   Wally

## Building and Testing

TODO

## Live Syncing with Studio

`studio.project.json` exists so you can serve the plugin into ServerStorage with a live Rojo session.
